mwsd - MicroWave Synthesizer Display
This is a small ncurses based application to read MIDI and SysEx data from
the Waldorf Microwave II/XT synthesizer, optionally displaying the
synthesizer's display contents on the computer screen.
This is free software, released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License version 3. A copy of the GPL is available in the file COPYING.

This application should work on Linux (and other Unices supporting either
ALSA and JACK) and Mac OS X).
Windows support would take some extra code and is thus omitted, at the moment.

The program can take a few options to set up the MIDI device and the
synthesizer's device ID, but it can also query them fully interactively and
is, thus, self explanatory.

If you have feedback or issues using and compiling this program, please get in
