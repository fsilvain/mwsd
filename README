mwsd - MicroWave Synthesizer Display
Copyright 2018 by Jeanette C. <jeanette@juliencoder.de>

SUMMARY
mwsd is a small cross-platform utility to show the Waldorf Microwave II/Xt's
display contents on a computer screen or display direct MIDI/SysEx data.
It is a terminal application using ncurses to display basic windows.
It is known to run on Linux and Mac OS X. Windows is not (yet) supported.
If you need Windows support, please get in contact.
The software was designed to assist blind users of the Microwave II/XT
synthesizer to enjoy their instruments, but it can also be used for remote
diagnosis.
