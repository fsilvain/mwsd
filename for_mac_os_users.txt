You're a Mac OS user and wonder how to install all this software?
It's easy, follow the steps below. You don't have to be an expert!
This short guide can't, owever, deal with everything. If you have problems, you
can contact me at jeanette@juliencoder.de . Be sure to include the word "mwsd"
on the subject line.

1. Open the terminal
2. type:
gcc
	The computer will tell you how to install the necessary package through the
	appstore, it's called xcode.
	Go and do that, it's free for all newer OS versions (>10.10 ?)
3. Install Homebrew, homebrew can install other missing things:
Paste the following line into your terminal:
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	Homebrew will tell you, what it needs to do. quoting from their website:
	"It's a very careful script." So don't worry.
4. Now use brew to install cmake:
	In the terminal type:
	brew install boost
5. Now install the boost libraries.
	Again in the termina type:
	brew install boost
6. Downloading RtMidi:
	In your favourite browser go to:
	http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~gary/rtmidi/release/
	download the latest version (at the bottom of the list)
	The file will be called rtmidi-x.y.z.tar.gz, where x, y and z are the version
	number, as of 08.2017 that is 3.0.0
7. Installing rtmidi:
	Go to the terminal, into the folder, where you've put rtmidi.
	If you didn't specify a folder, usually:
	cd ~/Downloads
	will get you there. Now type:
	tar zxvf rtmidi-x.y.z.tar.gz
	(replace x.y.z with the correct version, NOTE: you can complete filenames
	by pressing the <TAB> key)
	Next change into the unpacked directory:
	cd rtmidi-x.y.z
	Now type the following:
	./configure
	When that finishes without errors, type:
	make
	and when that finishes without errors, type:
	make install
	If you wish you can now remove the folder and the .tar.gz file
8. Now install mwsd:
	Change into the mwsd folder and type:
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	make install
	When there are no errors, you are done and can now call:
	mwsd --help

Congratulations and enjoy!

Jeanette
